# Character_Classification

The purpose of this project was to classify comic book characters as either good or evil based off features relating to their powerstats and identification. 

## Data
The Data for this project was scraped from the Superhero API.  Numerical Data from the powerstats category and categoral data such as the characters' biography, appearance, work, and connections were utilized.  

A majority of the categorical features was made binary (1 for YES and 0 for NO).

## Feature Engineering
Before engineering, the features used were the powerstats, base, occupation, aliases, and relatives and the character's publisher.
